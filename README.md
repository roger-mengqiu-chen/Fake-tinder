#Fake-Tinder

This is the backend of an application that mocks up the basic functionalities of social networking. 

The project is still under development. 

Currently, user can register, login, create profile, and upload profile images. 

Authentication is handled by Firebase. IdToken should be fetched manually as this is the job of front end.
